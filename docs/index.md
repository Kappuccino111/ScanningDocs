# 📚 PAPPL Documentation Overview

Welcome to the PAPPL documentation! This overview will guide you through various aspects of PAPPL—from its origins to scanning functionality and future goals. 🚀

Don’t worry, this won’t be another boring documentation read. 😴 I’ve been working on the scan integrations in PAPPL for almost **2 years** now, so this documentation dives into every nook and cranny possible. We start from the very basics and then layer things up. Every detail is broken down to make it as clear as possible. If you spot something wrong, feel free to open a Pull Request. Contributions are always welcome! 🛠️

This documentation is based on version **1.4.x** of PAPPL. Updates for the v2 master will be added once sufficient scanning functionality has been achieved upstream on **1.4.x**.
